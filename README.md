Unlike tools that transcribe after you stop speaking, localvoxtral streams text as the audio arrives, powered by Mistral AI's [Voxtral Mini 4B Realtime](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Voxtral-Mini-4B-Realtime-2602) running on your own Apple Silicon. It is built first for [prompting coding agents by voice](docs/coding-agents.md), and it stays a solid general dictation app everywhere else. Everything runs on-device — no account, no subscription, nothing leaving your Mac.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/T0mSIlver/localvoxtral/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Or download the latest `.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/T0mSIlver/localvoxtral/releases/latest). Requires an Apple Silicon Mac on macOS 15+. A first-launch wizard handles permissions and the engine download; if Gatekeeper complains about a hand-installed DMG, see the [install guide](docs/install.md).

## Features

- **Built for coding agents** — dictate prompts straight into any CLI agent ([opencode](integrations/opencode/README.md) gets its own plugin), in any terminal — Warp, WezTerm, kitty, Alacritty, and more; polishing understands developer speech: "dash dash force" → `--force`, "use auth dot t s" → `useAuth.ts` ([details](docs/coding-agents.md))
- **Claude Code aware** — dictation joins the *exact* session under your cursor — Ghostty, iTerm2, Terminal.app, a single [herdr](https://herdr.dev) or [cmux](https://github.com/manaflow-ai/cmux) pane, over SSH, or a [claude.ai/code](https://claude.ai/code) Remote Control tab in your browser — and grounds polishing in its screen, your last prompt, the files Claude just touched, and that repo's vocabulary ([details](docs/coding-agents.md#dictating-into-claude-code))
- **One key, two modes** — tap for a reviewable overlay with optional LLM polishing, hold to stream words live into the focused app ([shortcuts](docs/dictation.md))
- **Private by default** — audio, transcription, and polishing are local processes; no telemetry, no account, no cloud fallback ([how it works](docs/under-the-hood.md))
- **Menu bar native** — instant popover with dictation status at a glance, microphone picker, auto-copy of the final text, and the raw transcript one click away after a polished commit
- **Bring your own server** — dictation and polishing can each point at any OpenAI-compatible endpoint instead of the built-in local engines
- **Multilingual** — dictate in English, French, or any language [Voxtral](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Voxtral-Mini-4B-Realtime-2602) understands; polishing answers in the language you spoke (English and French are covered by the test suite)

## Personal fork additions

This fork keeps upstream's current architecture and adds a few local workflows and behaviors:

- an opt-in, configurable **Send Now** voice command for selected terminal apps in Live Auto-Paste;
- an explicit **Reset Accessibility Permission** troubleshooting action;
- personal replacement-dictionary entries under `Sources/localvoxtral/Resources/Config/`;
- `mise run build`, `mise run test`, `mise run test-failures`, `mise run package`, and `mise run install-local` tasks for local development. `test-failures` keeps successful runs concise and retains the full log when tests fail; `install-local` changes `~/Applications` and is never run during automated validation.

Upstream synchronization is merge-based and documented in `.agents/skills/sync-upstream/SKILL.md`.
